# Math for ML Coursework

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook for the MML coursework. 
The notebook is organized into sections for reproducing results and plots as described in the project report. Below is an outline of its contents.

## Notebook Contents

### Results Generation
- **Extra Trees**
   - Results for n = 9, 12, 15.
   - Label generation for corresponding n values.
- **Neural Networks**
   - Results for n = 9, 12, 15, 18, 24.
   - Label generation for corresponding n.
- **ResNets**
   - Results for n = 18, 24.
   - Label generation for corresponding n.
- **Logistic Regression**
   - Results for n = 9.

### Grid Search results
  - **Extra Trees**: n = 9, 12, 15.
  - **Neural Networks**: n = 9, 12, 15.

### Plot Reproduction
 - **Model Stability**:
   - Extra Trees.
   - Neural Networks.
 - **Neural Network Loss Curve**: Plots loss over epochs.
